# SpatialNLS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SpatialNLS is to provide users with convenient functions to
estimate statial lag and spatial error models with continuous and binary
outcomes using a non-linear least squares framework. This is achieved
through approximation of the spatial dependence implied by the model.
Utilizing non-linear least squares to estimate spatial models provides a
significant speed advantage in terms of compute time relative to more
numerically complex maximum likelihood or Bayesian techniques.

## Installation

You can install the released version of SpatialNLS from
[GitHub](https://github.com/loganstundal/spatialnls) with:

``` r
devtools::github_install("loganstundal/SpatialNLS")
```
