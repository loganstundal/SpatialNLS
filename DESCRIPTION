Description: This package provides users with the flexibility to estimate 
  spatial lag and spatial error models via non-linear least squares. Relative
  to maximum likelihood and Bayesian spatial modeling techniques, this provides
  a significant performance gain with relatively little bias tradeoff for most
  use cases.
